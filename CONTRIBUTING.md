# Contributing to stowage

Stowage is a small free software project. It welcomes contributions of all types!

## Before filing an issue

Feel free to file bugs. If something isn't a bug, it probably means the documentation or design has a deficiency, so that has value too. 

## Filing issues

Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to privately to the main author wherever possible; I treat security issues very seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.

Otherwise, when filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of stowage are you using (`stowage help` will show this, if you built from
   source please reference the commit you used)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

For enhancements, I like receiving user stories that demonstrate the use case and the value of the proposal.

## Contributing code

Please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before sending patches.

GitHub pull requests are absolutely fine; however, I reserve the right to grab the patches, alter them around a lot and commit that instead of the accepting the PR.

Please ensure that you are licensing your changes under the same terms as the original project, and that you have the ability or permission (Where required) to publish changes.
